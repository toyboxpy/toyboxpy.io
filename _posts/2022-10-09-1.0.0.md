Proud to announce that **toybox.py** has gone gold!

Version 1.0.0 is now available on **macOS**, **Linux** and **Windows**. Make sure you have a [supported version](/blog/installing-python) of Python then paste this in a <b>macOS</b> Terminal, a <b>Linux</b> shell prompt or a <b>Windows</b> Powershell:

```console
pip install toyboxpy
```

Now you're ready to start using one of the many **toyboxes** available whether it's importing [Tiled](https://github.com/DidierMalenfant/TiledUp){:target="_blank"} or [LDtk](https://github.com/NicMagnier/PlaydateLDtkImporter){:target="_blank"} levels, easily [animating sprites](https://github.com/Whitebrim/AnimatedSprite){:target="_blank"}, adding a [font](https://github.com/DidierMalenfant/FontSample){:target="_blank"} or some [physics](https://github.com/DidierMalenfant/playbox2d){:target="_blank"} to your **Playdate** project. It's all one command away.

Using **toybox.py** makes sure the librairies you use are maintained, supported and automatically updated for you. **toybox.py** takes care of any dependencies for you too.

New **toyboxes** are coming all the time and best of all it's super easy to [create](https://github.com/toyboxpy/toybox.py#creating-your-own-toyboxes) your own, providing **Lua** code, super fast **C** extensions or just **assets** for any projects.

This is a game changer for **Playdate** development and I think you're going to absolutely love it. What are you waiting for? Give it a try now!

With ‚ù§Ô∏è from Paris, France.
